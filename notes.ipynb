    "## Freecode Camp and Treehouse\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an algorithm? \n",
    "\n",
    "It is a **set of steps needed to complete a task**. To implement one: \n",
    "\n",
    "1 - We need to have a *clear problem statement* \n",
    "\n",
    "2 - A *specific order* for the steps \n",
    "\n",
    "3 - *Simple and distinct* steps \n",
    "\n",
    "To determine the  **efficiency** of an algorithm, its **worst case scenario** should be analyzed using two paradigms:\n",
    "\n",
    "1 - *Time complexity:* the less it takes to complete the task, the better \n",
    "\n",
    "2 - *Space complexity:* the less memory is used, the better\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary search\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's define a searching algorithm: binary search takes a **sorted** data list and returns the position in the list \n",
    "or a `None` type if target is not in the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Binary seach is a good basic searching algorithm due to its *sublinear* time complexity. It takes `O(log n)` time.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Fundamental operations on structures\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Reading\n",
    "2) Searching \n",
    "3) Inserting \n",
    "4) Deleting\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. What are data structures? \n",
    "\n",
    "The collection of values, the format they are stored in, their relationships to one another and \n",
    "the operations applied on them. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each data structure addresses a particular problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1 Types of insertions\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Inserting**: Linear runtime. Adds item to an existing index.\n",
    "- **Appending**: Constant runtime: in the average, has ammortized constant space \n",
    "complexity. Adds item to the end of the list. \n",
    "- **Extending**: `O(k)`, where `k = number of elements in the list` we are adding.\n",
    "Adds a list to another list by appending every element to the new list. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Deletion \n",
    "\n",
    "Has an upper bound of `O(n)` (linear runtime).\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Types of data structures \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.1 Arrays (native to most programming languages) \n",
    "\n",
    "A **contiguous** data structure, i.e it is stored in blocks in memory that are beside each other with no gaps. \n",
    "For this reason, accessing data in an array/Python list is a constant time operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are good for reading, but not that much for inserting and deleting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.2 Linked Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Linear data structure where each element is contained in a separate object called a **node**.A node consists of the actual data \n",
    "and a reference to the next node (or both the next and previous node in case of doubly linked lists). The first node in the list \n",
    "is called the **head** and last one the **tail**. \n",
    "\n",
    "*The list only maintains a reference to the head*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Better for inserting/deleting than array[<sup>[1]</sup>](#references).\n"

    "\n",
    "[1] Only prepending (inserting to head) and appending(inserting to tail) is better for a linked list than an array. Inserting and \n",
    "deleting data in a specific position in a linked list takes `O(1)` time. However, *searching* for data position takes `O(n)` \n",
    "time since we have to traverse the list."
